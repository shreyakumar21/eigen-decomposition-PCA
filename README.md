# eigen-decomposition-PCA
NMIST is a database that contains handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 
handwritten digits with a pixel size of 28*28 and a test set of 10,000 handwritten digits. These 
handwritten digits are also centred in a fixed-size image. In this assignment, I am using the Principal 
Component Analysis method to classify the digits and to reduce the number of features by projection 
of eigenvectors. In the end, the digits are classified using K-Nearest Neighbours classification method. 
I have also experimented the effects of changing the value of k in the kNN classifier.
